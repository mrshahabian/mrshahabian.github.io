Fully Funded PhD program focusing on deep learning, computer vision, and human activity recognition for ambient assisted living applications. 

Research involved developing multi-view camera systems, skeleton-based recognition models, and creating benchmark datasets (RHM-HAR series) for the research community.

Key achievements:
- Published multiple papers in top-tier conferences (BioRob, ICSR)
- Created publicly available datasets for HAR research
- Developed novel Transformer-based architectures for activity recognition
- Collaborated on multidisciplinary robotics projects
