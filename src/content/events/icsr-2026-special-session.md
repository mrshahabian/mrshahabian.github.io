### Description

As assistive technologies become increasingly essential in promoting autonomy, wellbeing, and participation—particularly for ageing populations and remote care models—this special session investigates how wearable robotics can enhance human function in everyday life, clinical therapy, and creative practices.

We focus on advances in exoskeletons, soft exosuits, and AI-powered assistive devices, drawing from multidisciplinary research across robotics, biomechanics, human–robot interaction, and healthcare. This includes systems that integrate multimodal sensing (EMG, EEG, IMU), machine learning for intent detection, and co-adaptive control for real-time human–robot collaboration.

Beyond physical support, we also explore emerging uses of assistive robots in **complementary therapies**, such as **art therapy**, where social and expressive robots contribute to cognitive and emotional wellbeing. The session highlights work at the intersection of rehabilitation, creativity, and socially responsive design.

### Key Themes

This special session will focus on the following key themes:

- **Wearable Assistive Systems**: Exoskeletons and exosuits for upper and lower limb support  
- **Multimodal Sensing and Intent Detection**: EMG, EEG, IMU, and biosignal fusion  
- **Adaptive and Co-Adaptive AI**: Deep learning and meta-learning for personalised assistance  
- **Human–Robot Interaction and Shared Autonomy**: Transparency, trust, and safe collaboration  
- **Rehabilitation and Remote Care**: Clinical integration, home-based therapy, and telepresence  
- **Social Robots in Creative Therapies**: Art therapy and emotional enrichment through robot interaction  
- **Digital Twins and Generative Models**: Simulation, prediction, and adaptive intervention planning  
- **Societal and Ethical Dimensions**: Long-term use, accessibility, and user agency  
- **Benchmarks and Validation**: Open datasets, real-world deployments, and reproducible studies

### Call for Papers

We invite submissions that explore technical, social, or therapeutic dimensions of assistive wearable robotics. This includes novel system design, clinical and creative applications, and interdisciplinary research that connects human augmentation with social robotics.

**Topics of Interest:**

- Exosuit and exoskeleton engineering  
- AI-driven intent detection and co-adaptation  
- Multimodal biosignal processing (EMG, EEG, IMU)  
- Social robots in therapeutic and creative settings
