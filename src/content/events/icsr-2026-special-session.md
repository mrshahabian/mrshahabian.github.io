### Description

As populations age and healthcare systems shift toward remote, decentralised care, assistive technologies are increasingly vital to supporting autonomy, wellbeing, and participation. This special session explores how wearable robotics, including powered exoskeletons, soft exosuits, and intelligent assistive devices, can extend human capability, enhance recovery, and improve quality of life across diverse settings.

Bridging robotics, biomechanics, AI, and human–robot interaction, this session examines how multimodal sensing (EMG, EEG, IMU), deep and meta-learning, and co-adaptive control frameworks are enabling more personalised, responsive, and intuitive forms of assistance. From clinical rehabilitation to home-based care and workplace augmentation, we explore how these systems are moving from controlled labs into complex, real-world environments.

Alongside technical innovation, this session foregrounds ethical and societal dimensions: How do users experience and trust robotic support? What are the implications of long-term wearable autonomy? And how can we design systems that adapt not just to movement, but to identity, intention, and context?

### Key Themes

This special session will focus on the following key themes:

- **Wearable Assistive Systems**: Exoskeletons and exosuits for upper and lower limb support
- **Multimodal Sensing and Intent Detection**: EMG, EEG, IMU, and biosignal fusion
- **Adaptive and Co-Adaptive AI**: Deep learning and meta-learning for personalised assistance
- **Human–Robot Interaction and Shared Autonomy**: Transparency, trust, and safe collaboration
- **Rehabilitation and Remote Care**: Clinical trials, in-home recovery, and telepresence integration
- **Digital Twins and Generative Models**: Simulation, prediction, and intervention planning
- **Societal and Ethical Dimensions**: Accessibility, user agency, and long-term deployment
- **Benchmarks and Real-World Validation**: Open datasets, field testing, and reproducibility

### Call for Papers

We invite submissions exploring innovative research, applications, and critical perspectives on assistive wearable robotics. Papers should address technical, human-centred, or societal aspects of human augmentation and wellbeing through robotic assistance.

**Topics of Interest:**
- Novel exoskeleton and exosuit designs
- AI-driven intent detection and prediction
- Multimodal biosignal processing and fusion
- User studies and long-term deployment experiences
- Ethical frameworks and user agency considerations
- Clinical validation and healthcare integration
- Benchmark datasets and evaluation methodologies
- Co-adaptive control and learning systems
- Telepresence and remote rehabilitation technologies

### Submission Guidelines

Papers will be peer-reviewed and published in the conference proceedings. We welcome full papers, short papers, and extended abstracts that contribute to advancing the field of assistive wearable robotics.
