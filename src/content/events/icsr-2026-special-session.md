### Description

This special session bridges the fields of assistive robotics, rehabilitation, and social human–robot interaction, with an invitation to explore new intersections with creative and expressive therapies. As the field of social robotics matures, it becomes increasingly important to consider not just how robots assist physically—but how they engage, empower, and emotionally support users in therapeutic contexts.

We focus on wearable robotic systems—such as exoskeletons, soft exosuits, and intelligent assistive devices—designed to enhance physical function, facilitate recovery, and promote independence in both clinical and everyday environments. These systems often integrate biosignals (EMG, EEG, IMU), deep learning models, and co-adaptive control for personalised support.

In addition to traditional rehabilitation, this session also invites contributions at the interface of assistive robotics and **creative therapies**—including **art therapy**—where **social robots and assistive technologies** are designed to support cognitive, emotional, and expressive goals. From supporting movement through collaborative painting to enabling voice and gesture in therapeutic storytelling, we aim to foreground how social and wearable robots can participate in multimodal, human-centred healing practices.

This session embraces ICSR’s mission of advancing socially intelligent robotics while building bridges with fields such as occupational therapy, cognitive neuroscience, digital arts, and healthcare design.

### Key Themes

- **Wearable Assistive Robotics**: Exosuits and exoskeletons for daily support and motor recovery  
- **Multimodal Sensing and Intent Detection**: EMG, EEG, IMU, and biosignal integration  
- **AI-Driven Adaptation**: Deep and meta-learning for real-time, personalised assistance  
- **Human–Robot Interaction in Rehabilitation and Art-Based Therapies**  
- **Social Robots in Creative and Complementary Therapy**: Use of robots in art therapy, music-based interventions, or storytelling  
- **Ethical and Inclusive Design**: Trust, long-term use, accessibility, and identity-sensitive interaction  
- **Real-World Evaluation**: Clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and deployment in care and cultural settings  
- **Benchmarks and Frameworks**: Open datasets, replicability, and cross-domain methodological tools

### Call for Papers

We welcome submissions that explore novel intersections between assistive robotics, creative expression, and therapeutic applications. We particularly encourage contributions that:

- Apply assistive or social robots in complementary therapies (e.g. art, music, narrative)
- Explore adaptive control and intent recognition using biosignals
- Address user agency, emotion, or trust in therapeutic HRI
- Present technical or empirical work on robot-supported rehabilitation and wellbeing
- Contribute datasets or methodologies for use in multi-domain studies

### Submission Guidelines

Accepted papers will be published in the ICSR 2026 proceedings. Submissions may include full papers, short papers, or extended abstracts that speak to the core or exploratory themes of this interdisciplinary session.
