**SWAG Project (Soft Wearable Assistive Garment)**
- Developing AI-driven intent-detection systems using multi-sensor biomechanical data (EMG, IMU, kinetics, kinematics)
- Designing deep learning-based sensor fusion framework for real-time motion recognition
- Implementing meta-learning and Transformer architectures for adaptive human-robot interaction
- Leading data collection and dataset creation for wearable sensor signals
- Collaborating with European partners on system integration and evaluation

**Hospital at Home / PRIME Study**
- Developing AI-driven multimodal pipeline for ambient assistive technology in virtual wards
- Designing multi-view Human Activity Recognition and sensor-fusion frameworks
- Creating Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios to enhance patient engagement
- Supporting post-surgery and heart failure recovery through adaptive assistance
- Collaborating with Princess Alexandra Hospital under Dinwoodie Charitable Company Research Grant (2025-2027)

Publishing research papers on deep learning, activity recognition, and intelligent systems derived from project outcomes.
