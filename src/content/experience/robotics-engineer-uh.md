**eSAM Project (Exposure Sensing Animated Mannequin)**

Designed and developed a human-sized robotic mannequin for chemical exposure testing and environmental sensing applications.

**Key Achievements:**
- Designed mechanical structure and actuation system for human-like movements
- Developed motor control systems with distributed chemical sensor integration
- Created web-based interface for real-time monitoring and actuation
- Implemented embedded communication using Modbus RTU across Arduino and Raspberry Pi modules
- Integrated Maxon motor drivers for precise motion control
- Built distributed sensor network for environmental monitoring

The project enables realistic testing of personal protective equipment and workplace exposure scenarios through programmable human-like movements and comprehensive sensor data collection.
