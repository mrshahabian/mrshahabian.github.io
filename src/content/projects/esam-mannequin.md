Designed and developed a human-sized robotic mannequin for chemical exposure testing and environmental sensing at the University of Hertfordshire.

## System Overview

A fully articulated robotic platform that simulates human movements and postures while collecting comprehensive environmental and exposure data through distributed chemical sensors.

## Key Components

- **Mechanical Design**: Human-proportioned structure with multiple degrees of freedom
- **Motor Control**: Precision control using Maxon motor drivers for realistic motion
- **Sensor Network**: Distributed chemical sensors across the mannequin body
- **Communication**: Modbus RTU protocol across Arduino and Raspberry Pi modules
- **Web Interface**: Real-time monitoring and control dashboard for remote operation

## Technologies
