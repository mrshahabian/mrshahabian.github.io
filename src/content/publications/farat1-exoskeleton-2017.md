abstract: "PExoskeleton robots were designed to increase strength and endurance of human limbs. This kind of robots could be used to increase the physical ability of either disabled or ordinary people for executing motion or manipulation tasks. The important point is to design such a shape that could be used safely, and accurately. This function could assist in walking, running, jumping or lifting objects that are beyond the human abilities to carry. In this paper, an upper body exoskeleton robot for rehabilitation applications, called FARAT1, is presented. This exoskeleton could be used for physiotherapy of whole arm of a patient, when the physiotherapist wears the MYO armband device and performs predefined actions. So the design process of the main parts including biomechanical modeling, conceptual design aspects, loading analysis and stress analysis of the hand are presented. The manufacturing points including 3D printing of the main parts are explained and final prototype of the robot with control instruments and design mobile application for control are shown."
