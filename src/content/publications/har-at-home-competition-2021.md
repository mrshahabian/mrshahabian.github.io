abstract: "Human activity recognition is an important aspect of many robotics applications. In this paper, we discuss how well the RoboCup@home competition accounts for the importance of such recognition algorithms. Using public benchmarks as an inspiration, we propose to add a new task that specifically tests the performance of human activity recognition in this league. We suggest that human-robot interaction research in general can benefit from the addition of such a task as RoboCup@home is considered to accelerate, regulate, and consolidate the field."
