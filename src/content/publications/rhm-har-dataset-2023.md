abstract: "With the recent increased development of deep neural networks and dataset capabilities, the Human Action Recognition (HAR) domain is growing rapidly in terms of both the available datasets and deep models. Despite this, there are some lacks at datasets specifically covering the Robotics field and Human-Robot interaction. We prepare and introduce a new multi-view dataset to address this. The Robot House Multi-View dataset (RHM) contains four views: Front, Back, Ceiling, and Robot Views. There are 14 classes with 6701 video clips for each view, making a total of 26804 video clips for the four views. The lengths of the video clips are between 1 to 5 seconds. The videos with the same number and the same classes are synchronized in different views. In the second part of this paper, we consider how single streams afford activity recognition using established state-of-the-art models. We then assess the affordance for each of the views based on information theoretic modelling and mutual information concept. Furthermore, we benchmark the performance of different views, thus establishing the strengths and weaknesses of each view relevant to their information content and performance of the benchmark. Our results lead us to conclude that multi-view and multi-stream activity recognition has the added potential to improve activity recognition results. "

A comprehensive RGB video dataset including:
- Multiple camera viewpoints covering entire living spaces
- Natural activities performed in realistic home settings
- Long-duration recordings capturing activity variations
- Comprehensive annotations and metadata
- Suitable for various computer vision tasks

The Robot House provides a unique realistic testbed for ambient assisted living research, and this dataset captures genuine human behaviors in that environment.
