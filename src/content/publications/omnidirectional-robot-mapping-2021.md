abstract: "Mapping is a fundamental requirement for robot navigation.In this paper, we introduce a novel visual mapping method that relies solely on a single omnidirectional camera.We present a metric that allows us to generate a map from the input image by using a visual Sonar approach.The combination of the visual sonars with the robot's odometry enables us to determine a relation equation and subsequently generate a map that is suitable for robot navigation.Results based on visual map comparison indicate that our approach is comparable with the established solutions based on RGB-D cameras or laser-based "

This work demonstrates how affordable omnidirectional cameras can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), reducing the cost barrier for robotics research and education.
