abstract: "In this paper we describe design and manufacturing process of mechanical robotic arm SAAM (seven axis anthropomorphic manipulator). The main goal is designing a suitable arm for use as a service robot arm in the home environment. Design is described in the five step: Loading analysis, Stress Analysis, Material Selection, Failure Theory consideration, Safety Factor calculation. All steps calculation are done for each part of the arm. Finally, the process of manufacturing the arm is explained and the real sample of the arm is manufactured."

Comprehensive design work for the SAAM (7-DoF) robotic arm used in domestic service robots, covering:
- Kinematic analysis and workspace optimization
- Mechanical component selection and design
- Manufacturing and assembly procedures
- Integration with mobile robot platforms
- Control system architecture

This arm was successfully deployed on service robots competing in RoboCup @Home league.
