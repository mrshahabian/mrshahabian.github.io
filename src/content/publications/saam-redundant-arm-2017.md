Comprehensive design work for the SAAM (7-DoF) robotic arm used in domestic service robots, covering:
- Kinematic analysis and workspace optimization
- Mechanical component selection and design
- Manufacturing and assembly procedures
- Integration with mobile robot platforms
- Control system architecture

This arm was successfully deployed on service robots competing in RoboCup @Home league.
